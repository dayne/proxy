h1. Silly Proxy

By Dayne Broderson

This proxy is a simple webrick proxy server.  Works for most basic web activities. I use it via an ssh tunnel from my laptop on a public wireless network to my workstation on a trusted network.

h2. Disclaimer

Holy cow!  This is certainly not something you should run on a public port.  I use this via ssh tunnels and don't allow others access to the port it runs on.  The logging file I have for my own interests but is clearly a terrible idea to make available to others.

h2. Usage

* Start it up:
@./proxy start@
* Is it running?
@./proxy status@
@curl http://localhost:5000@
* Stop it
@./proxy stop@

h2. Ssh tunnel

I hate remembering the syntax on my command line so I just have the following in my .ssh/config file on my laptop 
<pre>Host trusted_workstation
  LocalForward 5000 localhost:5000</pre>
Letting me do a simple @ssh trusted_workstation@ and have the tunnel setup.

Then point your web browser to use localhost:5000 as it's proxy.

The command line alternative:
@ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 trusted_workstation@ 

h2. Proxy Managers

Having to manually switch between proxy and direct in my browsers is lame so I use the following plugins:

* Chrome: "Switchy!":http://switchy.samabox.com/
* Firefox: (i forgot.. remind me)
